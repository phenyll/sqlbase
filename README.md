# sqlbase

I created this because sqlbase is a pain and odbc makes it even worse with non helpful senseless errors and the lack of useful documentation, drivers and so on. 

This wrapper for www.npmjs.com/package/odbc for use with Gupta SQLbase.

You still need to configure your ODBC stuff and have a valid connectionstring.

This is only battle-tested on windows.

PRs and discussion warmly welcome.
